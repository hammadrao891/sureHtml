SurePeople may also collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are bits of electronic information that a Website can transfer to a visitor's computer or device to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the Website.</p>
                            <p>Cookies help SurePeople improve the site's content by enhancing your overall experience on our Website. SurePeople does not store any personally identifiable information in these cookies. SurePeople uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").

The information generated by the cookie about use of the Website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers owned by Google.</p>
                            <p>Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. The collected data is not tied to any single individual, no individual profiles are created, and Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

                            <h3>How we use personal information</h3>
                            <h5>Registered User</h5>
                            <p>First and foremost, SurePeople does not sell or rent your personal information.</p>
                            <p>In addition to processing transactions, responding to requests, and providing Assessment Information to Clients and/or other persons or entities you designate, SurePeople may use anonymous, aggregate statistics about our Users, traffic patterns, and related information for exploring business development, advertising, and marketing opportunities and for educational purposes.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, SurePeople may use de-identified information including Assessment Information for analytical and statistical purposes, as well as to present anonymous profiles of candidates to prospective employers who we believe are looking for particular capabilities. In the event a particular Client is interested in learning your identity, we will seek your explicit consent before disclosing any personally identifiable information about you to that Client.</p>
                            <p>By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information by SurePeople as stated above. If we decide to change our Privacy Notice, we will post changes on this page and/or make other commercially reasonable efforts to make you aware of the changes made.</p>
                            <p>We provide information to service providers under contract who help with our business operations. We disclose information to law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other User to legal liability. In such events, we will disclose information that we believe to be relevant and necessary to the investigation or inquiry. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, we may disclose personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety or any person or property if we believe that the information in any way relates to that threat. In the event we are engaged in or contemplating a merger or other corporate acquisition with another business entity, personal information may be disclosed to and would likely be acquired by the other business entity. Such disclosure, if any, would be covered by an appropriate confidentiality agreement.</p>
                            <h3>How we secure personal information</h3>
                            <p>SurePeople is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. While we have implemented reasonable security measures to safeguard personal information, please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.</p>
                            <h3>How you can review or request changes to your personal information</h3>
                            <h5>Registered User</h5>
                            <p>You may review the personal information we have collected regarding you at any time by accessing your SurePeople profile settings. If you need to make any changes or corrections to your personal information please do so here. If you are unable to do this yourself, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@surepeople.com">privacy@surepeople.com</a> and describe specifically what needs to be changed, up to deletion of your SurePeople profile. We will try to complete your request as promptly and reasonably possible as permitted under applicable law. We reserve the right to request documentation from you to support any changes to the information.</p>
                            <p>In some circumstances, SurePeople collects information under the direction of its Clients and therefore has no direct relationship with the Registered Users whose personal information it processes on behalf of its Clients. A Registered User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal data should direct their query to the data owner (i.e., SurePeople’s Client). If the Client requests that SurePeople remove this personal data, SurePeople will respond to their request within 30 business days of its receipt of such request.</p>
                            <h5>Public User</h5>
                            <p>Upon request, SurePeople will make a reasonable effort to provide you whether we hold any of your personal information within reasonable time. Users may request updates, deletion, access, or changes to their personal information by contacting us at privacy@surepeople.com or by call us at 1-855-755-SURE (7873). We will respond to any requests for access to personal information within 30 days of receipt of such request.</p>
